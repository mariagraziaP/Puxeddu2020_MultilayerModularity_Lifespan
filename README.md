# Puxeddu2020_MultilayerModularity_Lifespan

This is the repository for the paper "The modular organization of brain cortical connectivity across the human lifespan" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920304602).

Here you will find codes to reproduce the analysis of the paper. The codes have been written in Matlab 2018a, but are also compatible with more recent versions (tested in Matlab 2019b).

This project relies on external libraries:
- BCT toolbox: to extract measures on brain networks and brain modules (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/).
- genlouvain: package to compute multilayer modularity optimization (http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain/GenLouvain).
- cbrewer: to get colors for nice visualizations (https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087-cbrewer-colorbrewer-schemes-for-matlab).
